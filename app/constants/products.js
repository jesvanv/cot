    bodyCopy: 'Barbecue has gone to the dogs! What dog can resist the tempting taste of smoked marrow bones or pig ears? We hardwood smoke our products to 145 degrees. Our proven process kills bacteria but does not compromise the integrity of the bone (no splintering or cracking!) or causing the marrow to melt out. Using the ancient French technique of charcuterie, we prepare these treats without cooking or the use of formaldehyde, mold inhibitors or preservatives. Our smoked bones and parts are US sourced and US made. Our product assortment caters to canines of all sizes.'

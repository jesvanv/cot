      Gluten and grain free, our treats and chews are great for pets with allergies.</p>

          <h2>Smoked Bones</h2>
          <p>Barbecue has gone to the dogs! What dog can resist the tempting taste of smoked marrow bones or pig ears?
            We hardwood smoke our products to 145 degrees. Our proven process kills bacteria but does not compromise the integrity of the bone (no splintering or cracking!) or causing the marrow to melt out.
            Using the ancient French technique of charcuterie, we prepare these treats without cooking or the use of formaldehyde, mold inhibitors or preservatives. 
            Our smoked bones and parts are US sourced and US made. Our product assortment caters to canines of all sizes.</p>

            <h2>Freeze Dried Treats</h2>
            <p>We bring another innovative product to you for your pet, Duragenic Freeze Dried Pet Treats. Conventional freeze-drying requires that products be cooked or high pressure pasteurized before being dried, but our proprietary process provides what your pet craves FARM FRESH veggies and proteins! Using 100% raw, hand cut produce and hand trimmed whole muscle meat freeze dried at the peak of freshness your pet gets a nutritious snack. NEVER cooked or pasteurized, but batch tested to ensure safety to you, your family, and your pet. Our treats enable you to get all the benefits of farm fresh produce and premium US sourced meat without the inconvenience of raw veggies and meat. Grain and gluten free, our Freeze-Dried Treats are suitable for all life stages of your pet.</p>
